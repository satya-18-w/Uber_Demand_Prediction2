# 🚕 Uber Demand Prediction

Predicting ride demand for Uber using machine learning and data science best practices.

---

## 📖 Overview

This project aims to forecast Uber ride demand using historical trip data. By leveraging advanced data engineering, feature extraction, and machine learning models, the project provides actionable insights to optimize ride allocation and operational efficiency.

Key features:
- End-to-end ML pipeline: data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
- Reproducible workflows using DVC and Docker.
- Visualizations for exploratory data analysis and model performance.

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

- **Data Ingestion:** Scripts in `src/data/` handle loading and preprocessing raw data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Use `src/features/` for feature extraction and transformation.
- **Model Training:** Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/` and scripts in `src/` for training and evaluation.
- **Visualization:** Explore data and results with scripts in `src/visualization/`.
- **Deployment:** Use `app.py` to serve predictions (extend as needed).
